Client.ahk goes out on a 5 minute interval and checks a website for messages and displays them.

The message should appear as follows

SUBJECT|MESSAGE|GC=FFFFFF GR=3 TC=Black MC=Black BC=FF0000 BW=4 BF=600 SC=500 SI=600 Image=245 C:\Windows\system32\shell32.dll|TARGET

Target can be ALL or a specific computer. If multiple computers are targeted, they are comma separated.

If you wish to have multiple alerts separate them with a Â¿ (ALT+168).
